# NoteTakerAssignment

This Note Taker application was made for users to input and save notes as reminders throughout the day. The user should be able to input a note Title of their choice, and then input note content of their choice. When the user is done, the save button will appear in the corner, which the user can click to append their saved notes on the side of the page. 

This assignment was my biggest learning experience yet, I learned a lot while making this application and had a lot of 'click moments.' I have a few bugs to figure out, like how to save and append the user input on the json file, along with appending them on the page for the user to see. Im having trouble pulling and saving data from the backend, but this is what this bootcamp is for! To learn!

To use this application, simply load the page and click "get started" You will be then taken to the notes page, where you can input a note, note title, and save it to your list of saved notes.
